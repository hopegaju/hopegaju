Hi, I’m Hope Gaju
I’m into both frontend and backend development, and I love exploring how design meets functionality. I’ve learned various programming languages and frameworks including Java, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in Java and backend systems.

I'm always up for collaborating on beginner-friendly or creative tech projects — especially ones that mix learning and fun. You can reach me via my email. I go by she/her.

Fun fact: I get my best coding ideas during moto rides and late-night walks.
