Hi, I’m Hope Gaju.
I’m into both frontend and backend development, and I love exploring how design meets functionality.
Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in Java and backend systems.
Always up for collaborating on fun, beginner-friendly or creative tech projects.
You can reach me via [insert your preferred contact method here].
I go by she/her.
A fun fact about me? I get my best coding ideas during moto rides and late-night walks.
